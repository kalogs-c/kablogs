Imagine that you have a application that have a tons of modules and you only need to import one of them per run, how can you write an code that only import the libraries that this given module uses? 
In this article I'll show how I did when I was exposed to this situation twice, one of them writing an web scrapper that scap content from different web sites using [Puppetter](https://pptr.dev/). 
On this post I'll show you a simple example cli app that gets the module name from command line argument. 
The modules that we'll use are [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) an [Digimon API](https://digimon-api.vercel.app/) All the source will be avaible on github.

## Creating project
So lets create our typescript project, note that i'm using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) but you can use the package manager that you want:

```sh
# Create package.json
‚ùØ pnpm init 

# Install typescript dependencies
‚ùØ pnpm add -D typescript @types/node ts-node

# Axios for http requests
‚ùØ pnpm add axios

# Create tsconfig.json
# This part you can just copy my tsconfig on github, I've made a few changes like output directory 
# but if you want to customize your self run
‚ùØ npx tsc --init

# Create src folder, that will include all our ts files
‚ùØ mkdir src

# Create our main file
‚ùØ touch src/main.ts

# Create our DataSources folder, which will stores all our polymorphic classes
‚ùØ mkdir src/DataSources

# Inside this folder we will create a DataSource.ts file, that is our skeleton interface
# All the other classes will implement this inteface
‚ùØ touch src/DataSources/DataSource.ts

# Now we can create our modules files.
# I will create two, one for the PokeAPI and the other to DigimonAPI
‚ùØ touch src/DataSources/Pokemon.ts src/DataSources/Digimon.ts

# And now you can open the project on your favorite text editor/IDE
# I use neovim so just type
‚ùØ vim
```

Our project structure will looks to something similar to this
```
Project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataSources
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataSources.ts
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pokemon.ts
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Digimon.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

## Main Interface and types
We will start editing our DataSource.ts file, adding the main interface and also a target type, that all modules have to parse to.
```ts
/* src/DataSources/DataSource.ts */
interface DataSource {
  New: () => Promise<DataSource>;

  getMonster: (name: string) => Promise<MonsterData>;
}

// Don't forget to export
export default DataSource;
```

The `New()` function will act like a async contructor of our class, some situations we have to to async stuff before instanciate the object, and creating a function to do this will create a pattern and make our code more readable. Node that the expected return of this method is a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that contains something that implements `DataSource` when resolved.

The `getMonster()` method receives the monster name that we want and return an [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that when resolved returns an instance of `MonsterData` that describe the data that we want to retrive from the APIs.

You've probably notice that the type `MonsterData` does not exist yet, so let's create it. You can create it on a separated file, but I'll still use the same one.

```ts
/* src/DataSources/DataSource.ts */
export type MonsterData = {
  name: string,
  img: string,
}
```

## Implementing the Interface

Now let's jump to our API consumers, I'll start with PokeAPI because Pokemon is better than Digimon üòù

```ts
/* src/DataSources/Pokemon.ts */
import axios, { AxiosInstance } from "axios";
import DataSource, { MonsterData } from "./DataSource";

class Pokemon implements DataSource {
  private client: AxiosInstance;

  constructor() {
    this.client = axios.create({
      baseURL: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon",
      timeout: 2000,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    })
  }

  public async New(): Promise<Pokemon> {
    return this;
  }

  public async getMonster(pokemonName: string): Promise<MonsterData> {
    const pokeApiResponse = await this.client.get(`/${pokemonName}`);

    const pokemonData = pokeApiResponse.data;

    return {
      name: pokemonName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + pokemonName.slice(1),
      img: pokemonData.sprites.front_default,
    }
  }
}

// Don't forget to export without instanciate the class
// For example, dont't type `export default new`
export default Pokemon;
```

Really simple file, but has four things that we may notice. 

### 1. First is that our class [implements](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#implementing-an-interface) the `DataSource` interface.
```ts
class Pokemon implements DataSource {
    ...
}
```

### 2. The `New()` "async contructor"

Note that this function just return our object, but if we had the need to do some asynchronous calls before instanciate the class, we would do here. Just to examplify, imagine that before do the http requests we had to login and get an token on another endpoint and save on our class. Would be something like this

```ts
public async New(): Promise<DataSource> {
  const token = await getToken();
  this.client = axios.client({
    ...,
    Headers: {
      ...,
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Data modeling

Check `getMonster()` method, we always return a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) with `MonsterData` type inside it, that means that on we always have to parse the data model returned from the api to this expected model. And It's recomended that you create custom types that describes which kind of data we expect to receive from the http request, I didn't do that because this is a really simple project.

### 4. Exporting our class

I'm exporting the class, and not the object. 
Notice that `export default Pokemon` is different than `export default new Pokemon`.
There is no right or wrong way here, but be sure that all your classes follow the same pattern.
On this project all classes we will export without the `new` keyword.

## Digimon implementacion

This one will be basically the samething that we did on Pokemon.ts file

```ts
/* src/DataSources/Pokemon.ts */
import axios, { AxiosInstance } from "axios";
import DataSource, { MonsterData } from "./DataSource";

class Digimon implements DataSource {
  private client: AxiosInstance;

  constructor() {
    this.client = axios.create({
      baseURL: "https://digimon-api.vercel.app/api/digimon/name/",
      timeout: 2000,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    })
  }

  public async New(): Promise<Digimon> {
    return this;
  }

  public async getMonster(digimonName: string): Promise<MonsterData> {
    const digimonApiResponse = await this.client.get(`/${digimonName}`);

    const [digimonData] = digimonApiResponse.data;

    return {
      name: digimonData.name,
      img: digimonData.img,
    }
  }
}

export default Digimon;
```

The only thing different here is how we consume the API, and even that is kinda similar

## Main file and dynamic import

In our main.ts file let's write our dynamic code

```ts
/* src/main.ts */
import DataSource from "./DataSources/DataSource"

(async () => {
  const [dsName, monsterName] = process.argv.slice(2);

  // Return error when no param are passed
  if (!dsName || !monsterName) throw new Error("Usage: node main.js <DataSouce> <MonsterName>");

  const dataSource: DataSource = await (
    new (await import(`./DataSources/${dsName}`)).default
  ).New()

  console.table(await dataSource.getMonster(monsterName));
})()
```

So let's jump to the part where things happen

```ts
const dataSource: DataSource = await ( 
  new (await import(`./DataSources/${dsName}`)).default // Import and instanciate the class
).New() // Call the method that do async stuff
```

Explaining each part we have

```ts
await import(`./DataSources/${dsName}`)

// Returns
{ default: class }
```

This block of code returns an object with all the exported stuff inside it, the one that matter for us is the default one, that's why we usethe  `.default` after the close parenthesis, and as returns a class, we use the `new` keyword to instanciate it.

the first await is connected to the `.New()` method, that returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) with the Object instanciated inside of it.

Now we have our class totally instanciated and we can call the methods inside the `DataSource` interface. We do this on this block

```ts
console.table(await dataSource.getMonster(monsterName));
```

## Testing
Now, if we execute the project passing through command line argument our module and our monster name, we will get this result

### Pokemon
```sh
‚ùØ npx ts-node src/main.ts Pokemon snorlax
```
```json
{
  name: "Snorlax",
  img: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/143.png"
}
```

### Digimon
```sh
‚ùØ npx ts-node src/main.ts Digimon patamon
```
```json
{
  name: "Patamon",
  img: "https://digimon.shadowsmith.com/img/patamon.jpg"
}
```

Note that our first param is exactly our file name where we wrote the class, and not the class name

## Tchau üëã

That's it for today, feel free to add something and if I made something wrong or that can be improved please tell me and I will release a patch correcting and adding credits. 

And remember that all the source code of this mini project are avaible on [github](https://github.com/kalogs-c/super-polymorphism).

Tchau!!
